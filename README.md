# Facial-Recognition-Model-with-Python
## Introduction
---
This project presents a deep learning-based facial recognition model capable of accurately identifying individuals from a given dataset of images. The model is trained on a large dataset of 108 images of 6 individuals, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
## Key Features
---
Based on the training data, the model will identify and recognize faces present in the image.
## Dataset
---
The dataset I used to train the model consists of a collection of images of a person that I gathered and compiled, then extracted the faces from.

## Requirements
---
- **python 3.12**
- **cv2**
- **numpy**
- **sklearn**
- **PIL**
